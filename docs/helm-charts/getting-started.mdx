## Deploying a local chart

This tutorial will provide an example on how to deploy a local chart.

1. Download the chart files for the `leaderboard` chart from the Mina Foundation Git repository.
2. Extract the files from the downloaded archive to a local directory.
3. Install the chart using the `helm install` command and passing in the path to the chart directory. For example:

```bash
helm install leaderboard ./leaderboard
```

This command installs the `leaderboard` chart using the local files in the `leaderboard directory`. You can adjust the command to fit your environment and specific requirements.
