# Tutorial 10: Account Updates

The fundamental data structure that Mina transactions are built from is called an _account update_. Account updates are a flexible and powerful data structure that can express all kinds of updates, events, and preconditions you use to develop smart contracts.

Each zkApp transaction constructed by o1js is composed of one or more [AccountUpdate](../o1js-reference/classes/AccountUpdate) classes, which are a set of instructions for the Mina network to perform, such as altering on-chain state, emitting an event, and so on.

Each `AccountUpdate` can make assertions about its account, apply updates to its account, and make assertions about its child `AccountUpdates`.

Transactions are structured as a list of trees of `AccountUpdates` applied with a [pre-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal).

## Permissions, Preconditions, and Composability

Permissions, preconditions, composability, and tokens are the core features of zkApps that are implemented using `AccountUpdates`.

To learn more, see these o1js docs:

- [Permissions](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/feature-overview/permissions)
- [On-Chain Values](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/feature-overview/on-chain-values)

In this tutorial, you learn the essential account update features.

## AccountUpdate contents

The `AccountUpdate` class is a set of instructions for the Mina network. It includes preconditions (conditions that must be true for the account update to be applied) and a list of state updates that need to be authorized by a signature or proof.

Each [AccountUpdate](/zkapps/o1js-reference/classes/AccountUpdate) class has these components:

- `PublicKey`: The account address for the account update
- `TokenId`: A unique hash representing the custom token. Defaults to the MINA TokenId (`1`).

  Together, `PublicKey` and `TokenId` uniquely identify an account on the Mina network.

- `Preconditions`: Conditions that must be true for the account update to be applied. Corresponds to assertions in an o1js method.
- `Updates`: Things changed by the account update, such as including the zkApp state, permissions, and verification key.
- `BalanceChange`: Any changes to the balance
- `Authorization`: How the zkApp is authorized; must be a proof (corresponding to the verification key on the account), a signature, or none. See [Authorizations](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/introduction-to-zkapps/interact-with-mina#authorizations).

Other `AccountUpdate` components are available to use, but are not covered in this tutorial:

- `MayUseToken`: Whether the zkApp has permissions to manipulate its token.
- `Layout`: Allows for assertions about the structure of an `AccountUpdate`.

## Account updates for a non-upgradable zkApp

If the verification key cannot be changed, the zkApp smart contract is considered non-upgradeable. The `setVerificationKey` permission sets the ability to change the verification key of the account.

Now, you can start building an example zkApp to explore permissions, preconditions, and composability with `AccountUpdates`.

### Visualize transactions

To visualize transactions, use the `mina-transaction-visualizer` library. Install this library to use in your own zkApp:

```sh
npm install mina-transaction-visualizer --save
```

## Smart Contracts

In this tutorial, you build two smart contracts:

- `ProofsOnlyZkApp`: Non-upgradeable proof only
- `SecondaryZkApp`: the other zkApp

The full source code for this tutorial is provided in the [examples/zkapps/10-account-updates](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/10-account-updates) directory on GitHub.

### Non-upgradeable proof only

The full example code is provided in the [examples/zkapps/10-account-updates/src/ProofsOnlyZkApp.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/10-account-updates/src/ProofsOnlyZkApp.ts) file.

Goal: Configure this zkApp to be modifiable only by using proofs.

For this example, the zkApp is not upgradable after it is deployed. This means that while the zkApp developer owns the private key to initially deploy the zkApp, after its first deployment, the zkApp requires proof authorization and consequently can be updated only transactions that fulfill the zkApp smart contract logic. The private key is no longer useful for anything.

This zkApp has methods that call other methods to let you explore the impacts to a transaction's account updates.

1. Start by adding the main contents of the zkApp:

  ```ts
  export class ProofsOnlyZkApp extends SmartContract {
    @state(Field) num = State<Field>();
    @state(Field) calls = State<Field>();

    async deploy() {
      await super.deploy();
      this.account.permissions.set({
        ...Permissions.default(),
        setDelegate: Permissions.proof(),
        setPermissions: Permissions.proof(),
        setVerificationKey: {
          auth: Permissions.proof(),
          txnVersion: TransactionVersion.current(),
        },
        setZkappUri: Permissions.proof(),
        setTokenSymbol: Permissions.proof(),
        incrementNonce: Permissions.proof(),
        setVotingFor: Permissions.proof(),
        setTiming: Permissions.proof(),
      });
    }

    @method async init() {
      this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
      this.account.provedState.get().assertFalse();

      super.init();
      this.num.set(Field(1));
      this.calls.set(Field(0));
    }

    ...
  ```

  This code configures the zkApp as described and initializes the zkApp with the values you want.

  By asserting that `provedState` is `false` in `init()`, you ensure that `init()` cannot be called again after the zkApp is set up during the initial deployment. Without this assertion, your zkApp could be reset by anyone calling the `init()` method on your zkApp.

  :::tip
  This assertion is a recommended best practice for most zkApps.
  :::

1. Next, add two functions:

  ```ts
    ...
    @method async add(incrementBy: Field) {
      this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
      this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

      const num = this.num.getAndRequireEquals();
      this.num.set(num.add(incrementBy));

      await this.incrementCalls();
    }

    @method async incrementCalls() {
      this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
      this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

      const calls = this.calls.getAndRequireEquals();
      this.calls.set(calls.add(Field(1)));
    }
    ...
  ```

  These methods also assert `provedState` is `true` to ensure the zkApp was initialized as expected because `provedState` becomes true after `init()` is invoked.

  :::tip
  This assertion is a recommended best practice for most zkApps.
  :::

  The `add()` method calls the `incrementCalls()` method. You can see how this is reflected in the `add()` transaction's `AccountUpdate` structure.

1. Finally, add one more function, `callSecondary()`, that calls a different zkApp:

  ```ts
    ...

    @method async callSecondary(secondaryAddr: PublicKey) {
      this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
      this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

      const secondaryContract = new SecondaryZkApp(secondaryAddr);
      const num = this.num.getAndRequireEquals();

      await secondaryContract.add(num);

      // NOTE this gets the state at the start of the transaction
      this.num.set(secondaryContract.num.get());

      await this.incrementCalls();
    }
  }
  ```

  The `callSecondary()` method takes the address of the other zkApp, `SecondaryZkApp`, and calls a method on it. Note that the impact of calling that method occurs after this set of AccountUpdates—so when you call `secondaryContract.num.get()`, it gets the value before this transaction is applied.

Finally, look briefly at [SecondaryZkApp.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/10-account-updates/src/SecondaryZkApp.ts) that contains:

```ts
export class SecondaryZkApp extends SmartContract {
  @state(Field) num = State<Field>();

  async deploy() {
    await super.deploy();
    this.account.permissions.set({
      ...Permissions.default(),
    });
  }

  @method async init() {
    this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.account.provedState.get().assertFalse();

    super.init();
    this.num.set(Field(12));
  }

  @method async add(incrementBy: Field) {
    this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

    const num = this.num.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.num.set(num.add(incrementBy));
  }
}
```

You declare functions for initializing the account and the `add()` method that is called from the earlier `ProofOnlyZkApp`.

### Running Your Smart Contracts and Visualizing the AccountUpdates

Now it's time to learn about the [main.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/zkapps/10-account-updates/src/main.ts) file that creates transactions with the earlier smart contracts and the account update visualizations it creates.

1. Import the transaction visualizer:

  ```ts
  ...
  import { showTxn, saveTxn, printTxn } from 'mina-transaction-visualizer';
  ...
  ```

  This provides three functions:

  ```ts
  // creates a png file of a transaction, and opens it in a local image viewer
  async showTxn(txn: Mina.Transaction, name: string, legend: Legend)

  // creates a png file of a transaction, and saves it to a path
  saveTxn(txn: Mina.Transaction, name: string, legend: Legend, path: string)

  // prints a nicely formatted view of a transaction
  printTxn(txn: Mina.Transaction, name: string, legend: Legend)

  // with legend type, to replace public keys with human readable strings:
  type Legend = { [pk: string]: string };
  ```

1. Next, define the legend as follows:

  ```ts
  const legend = {
    [proofsOnlyAddr.toBase58()]: 'proofsOnlyZkApp',
    [secondaryAddr.toBase58()]: 'secondaryZkApp',
    [deployerAccount.toBase58()]: 'deployer',
  };
  ```

1. Create and send a deploy transaction, then visualize it:

  ```ts
  const deployTxn = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, async () => {
    AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployerAccount, 2);
    await proofsOnlyInstance.deploy();
    await secondaryInstance.deploy();
  });

  await deployTxn.prove();
  deployTxn.sign([deployerKey, proofsOnlySk, secondarySk]);

  await showTxn(deployTxn, 'deploy_txn', legend);

  await deployTxn.send();
  ```

This yields the following visualization of `deployTxn`.

<img src="/img/tutorial-10-deploy_txn.png" width="100%" />

This [visualization](/img/tutorial-10-deploy_txn.png) is best viewed in a new tab.

The deploy transaction includes 5 accountUpdates represented as ovals. Described from left to right;

1. Takes the new account fee from the deployer for deploying the zkApps.
   Note the `-2` on the `balanceChange` field.
2. Deploys the `proofsOnlyZkApp` instance.
   Note the permissions are all set to the values in the zkApp's `deploy` field, and the `preconditions` asserting the nonce, so the transaction can't be applied more than once.
3. Initializes the `proofsOnlyZkApp`.
   Note the precondition that it can't already be in a proved state.
4. Deploys an instance of `secondaryZkApp`.
   Note the permissions here are set to default values, in contrast to the deployment in the `proofsOnlyZkApp` example.
5. Initializes the `secondaryZkApp` instance.

When the transaction is run on chain, these account updates are checked by the Mina network and applied if valid. Each `AccountUpdate` class includes either a proof corresponding to the verification key in the zkApp account on-chain or a signature corresponding to the zkApp address. In this case, only proof authorization is allowed.

### Call `add()` on `proofsOnlyZkApp`

1. Call `add()` on your instance of `proofsOnlyZkApp`:

  ```ts
  const txn1 = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, async () => {
    await proofsOnlyInstance.add(Field(4));
  });

  await txn1.prove();

  await showTxn(txn1, 'txn1', legend);

  await txn1.send();
  ```

This returns the following visualization of `txn1`:

<img src="/img/tutorial-10-txn1.png" width="100%" />

See download link [here](/img/tutorial-10-txn1.png).

### Two AccountUpdates

Now there are two AccountUpdates:

- The parent corresponds to the `add()` method call
- The child corresponds to the `this.incrementCalls()` call that the parent makes.

One update is the child because it was called from the parent, which also implies that the parent has the child included as part of its proof. To learn more about parent/child account updates, see [Signing transactions and explicit account updates](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/introduction-to-zkapps/interact-with-mina#signing-transactions-and-explicit-account-updates) in the Payment to zkApp example.

As a reminder, this update corresponds to code:

```ts
  ...
  @method async add(incrementBy: Field) {
    this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

    const num = this.num.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.num.set(num.add(incrementBy));

    await this.incrementCalls();
  }

  @method async incrementCalls() {
    this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

    const calls = this.calls.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.calls.set(calls.add(Field(1)));
  }
  ...
```

View the [account updates visualization](/img/tutorial-10-deploy_txn.png) again.

- The first AccountUpdate sets the state of `appState[0]` to `5` — corresponding to the value passed to `this.num.set()` in the `add()` method.
- In the second AccountUpdate, `appState[1]` is set to `1`—corresponding to the value passed to `this.calls.set()` in the `incrementCalls()` contract.

Finally, call `callSecondary` on your instance of `proofsOnlyZkApp`:

```ts
const txn2 = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, async () => {
  await proofsOnlyInstance.callSecondary(secondaryAddr);
});

await txn2.prove();

await showTxn(txn2, 'txn2', legend);
await saveTxn(deploy_txn, 'deploy_txn', legend, './txn2.png');

await txn2.send();
```

This returns the following visualization of `txn2`:

<img src="/img/tutorial-10-txn2.png" width="100%" />

This [txn2 visualization](/img/tutorial-10-txn2.png) is best viewed in a new tab.

And a quick reminder of the code for `callSecondary()`:

```ts
  @method async callSecondary(secondaryAddr: PublicKey) {
    this.account.provedState.getAndRequireEquals();
    this.account.provedState.get().assertTrue();

    const secondaryContract = new SecondaryZkApp(secondaryAddr);
    const num = this.num.getAndRequireEquals();

    await secondaryContract.add(num);

    // NOTE this gets the state at the start of the transaction
    this.num.set(secondaryContract.num.get());

    await this.incrementCalls();
  }
```

This call produces three accountUpdates:

- `callSecondary()` (the parent)
- `secondaryZkApp.add()` (the left child)
- `incrementCalls()` (the right child)

As described in the code comment, `callSecondary` sets `this.num` to `12` which is the value of `secondaryContract` at the "start" of the transaction.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have explored the core features of AccountUpdates and learned about visualizing the AccountUpdates for a set of transactions. You can build more complicated transactions that involve multiple zkApps. This tutorial builds a foundational understanding of how o1js and zkApps work to enable permissions, preconditions, and composability.
