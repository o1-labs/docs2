# Tutorial 1: Hello World 

## Overview

You can find the full source code for this example [here](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/tree/main/01-hello-world).

## Setup

First, install the [Mina zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli) if you haven’t already done so.

#### Dependencies

You'll need the following installed to use the zkApp CLI:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `--experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

If you have an older version installed, we suggest installing a newer version
using the package manager for your system: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (Mac),
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On
Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource
([deb](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall) or
[rpm](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall)), as recommended
by the NodeJS Project.

#### Installation

```sh
$ npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

To test you have zkapp-cli installed, run

```sh
$ zk --version
```

This tutorial has been tested as of zkapp-cli version `0.4.16`.

## Create a new project

Now that you have the tooling installed, we can start building our application.

First, make a new project, by typing

```sh
$ zk project 01-hello-world
```

This will make a new folder called `01-hello-world` in your current directory. It will be prepopulated with some files.

First, change directory into the new project, and list the contents of the project

```sh
$ cd 01-hello-world
$ ls
LICENSE           build             jest.config.js    package-lock.json tsconfig.json
README.md         config.json       keys              package.json
babel.config.cjs  jest-resolver.cjs node_modules      src
```

The two folders we will focus on, are `build`, and `src`. 

`src` contains the TypeScript code for your project, while `build` contains compiled JavaScript code that can be executed.

### Preparing the project

We will start by creating files for our project, and deleting the default files that come with the new project.

First, delete the old files. Enter:

```sh
$ rm src/Add.ts
$ rm src/Add.test.ts
```

And generate new files for our project. Enter:

```sh
$ touch src/Square.ts
$ touch src/main.ts
```

`Square.ts` will contain our smart contract code, while main.ts will contain code to interact with the smart contract from the CLI. In future tutorials, we will see how to interact with a smart contract from the browser or user device instead of just the command line.

In addition, open up `src/index.ts` in a text editor. change instances of `Add` to `Square`, to match our new project.

Afterwards, the file should look like:
```
import { Square } from './Square.js';

export { Square };
```

### Build Run Loop

To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, and run the JavaScript code, type

```sh
$ npm run build
$ node build/src/main.js
```

The first line creates JavaScript code in the build directory, while the second line runs the code in `src/main.ts`.

You can also combine these together into one line, with

```sh
$ npm run build && node build/src/main.js
```

This will run `main` if the build is successful. This command should fail at this point though, since we haven't written the `Square` smart contract yet.

## Write the zkApp Smart Contract

Now we will proceed in writing `src/Square.ts`, our smart contract. Line numbers are provided for convenience. A complete version of this file can be found [here](https://github.com/es92/zkApp-examples/blob/main/01-hello-world/src/Square.ts)

### Imports

First open up `src/Square.ts` in your editor. Then add at the top of the file:

```ts
  1 import {
  2   Field,
  3   SmartContract,
  4   state,
  5   State,
  6   method,
  7   DeployArgs,
  8   Permissions,
  9 } from 'snarkyjs';
```

What each of these are:

* Field: The native "number" type in SnarkyJS. You can think of these as unsigned integers.
* SmartContract: The class that creates zkApp smart contracts
* state: a convenience decorator used within zkApp smart contracts to create references to state stored on chain
* State: a class used within zkApp smart contracts to create state stored on chain
* method: a convenience decorator used within zkApp smart contracts to create new smart contract functions
* DeployArgs: The type for arguments submitted to a newly deployed smart contract
* Permissions: An collection of methods for manipulating zkApp smart contract permissions

### Smart contract class

Now, we will write the smart contract. Write in your file
```ts
 10
 11 export class Square extends SmartContract {
 12   @state(Field) num = State<Field>();
 13
 14 }
```

This creates a new smart contract, called `Square`, with one state object, `num`, of type `Field`. zkApps can have up to 8 Fields worth of state stored on chain. A later tutorial will discuss options for offchain state.

Now, we will add our methods. First, 
```ts
 11 export class Square extends SmartContract {
 12   @state(Field) num = State<Field>();
 13
 14   deploy(args: DeployArgs) {
 15     super.deploy(args);
 16     this.setPermissions({
 17       ...Permissions.default(),
 18       editState: Permissions.proofOrSignature(),
 19     });
 20   }
 21 
 22 }
```

This method tells us how we want to deploy our smart contract. This will be the same for many smart contracts. Note that the way this smart contract is declared, state can be edited with _either_ a proof or a signature. So whoever owns the private key for this smart contract can edit its state.

Next, we will add an "init" method:

```ts
 18       editState: Permissions.proofOrSignature(),
 19     });
 20   }
 21
 22   @method init() {
 23     this.num.set(Field(3));
 24   }
 25 
 26 }
```

This method will determine the initial state of the smart contract on chain. In this case, we will initialize the on chain variable `num` to be `3`.

Lastly, we will add the update function:
```ts
 23     this.num.set(Field(3));
 24   }
 25
 26   @method update(square: Field) {
 27     const currentState = this.num.get();
 28     this.num.assertEquals(currentState);
 29     square.assertEquals(currentState.mul(currentState));
 30     this.num.set(square);
 31   }
 32
 33 }
```

This completes the smart contract!

This tells us the rules for updating the smart contract. In this example, we are saying that, if the update function is provided the square of a `num`, update `num` to that value. This is accomplished through asserting conditions throughout the zkApp function. If any of these assertions fail, a proof will not be able to be generated, and so the on chain state will not be able to be updated.

Note  the functions for getting and setting on chain state (`get` and `set`), and the functions on the fields for doing arithmetic (`mul`). You can find more convenience functions in the API docs [here](http://localhost:3000/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference).

The inputs to methods in SnarkyJS are private. However in this example, since we set `this.num` to be `square`, this example does not use any privacy. A future tutorial will cover an example leveraging privacy.

## Write the zkApp UI (CLI)

Next, we will write a program that interacts with our smart contract. 

Open up `src/main.ts` in your editor.

### Imports

Now add:

```ts
  1 import { Square } from './Square.js';
  2 import {
  3   isReady,
  4   shutdown,
  5   Field,
  6   Mina,
  7   PrivateKey,
  8   PublicKey,
  9   AccountUpdate,
 10 } from 'snarkyjs';
 11
 ...
```

What each of these imports are:

* isReady: an asynchronous promise that tells us when SnarkyJS is loaded and ready
* shutdown: a function that closes our program
* Field: SnarkyJS' unsigned integer type, that we've seen above
* Mina: A class for the Mina blockchain, which we will load the smart contract to and intreact with 
* PrivateKey: a class with functions for manipulating private keys
* PublicKey: a class with functions for manipulating private keys
* AccountUpdate: a class for creating new accounts

### Main and Local Blockchain

Now add the following code:

```ts
...
 11
 12 (async function main() {
 13   await isReady;
 14
 15   console.log('SnarkyJS loaded')
 16
 17   const Local = Mina.LocalBlockchain();
 18   Mina.setActiveInstance(Local);
 19   const deployerAccount = Local.testAccounts[0].privateKey;
 20
 21   console.log('Shutting down')
 22
 23   await shutdown();
 24 })();
 ...
 ```

Now when you run `npm run build; node build/src/main.js`, your main function should run!

While applications in production should be deployed to the blockchain, a "local" blockchain is available to simplify and speed up development. This local blockchain provides pre-funded accounts (such as our `deployerAccount`). Later tutorials will discuss how to use the real blockchain through mainnet or a devnet. Note that zkApps are currently available on Berkeley, Mina's public testnet, which is in its final stages of testing before mainnet.

### Initializing our smart contract

Now, we add code to initalize the smart contract. Comments are provided to break down each stage.

```ts
...
 19   const deployerAccount = Local.testAccounts[0].privateKey;
 20
 21   // ----------------------------------------------------
 22
 23   // create a destination we will deploy the smart contract to
 24   const zkAppPrivateKey = PrivateKey.random();
 25   const zkAppAddress = zkAppPrivateKey.toPublicKey();
 26
 27   // create an instance of Square - and deploy it to zkAppAddress
 28   const zkAppInstance = new Square(zkAppAddress);
 29   const deploy_txn = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
 30     AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount(deployerAccount);
 31     zkAppInstance.deploy({ zkappKey: zkAppPrivateKey });
 32     zkAppInstance.init();
 33     zkAppInstance.sign(zkAppPrivateKey);
 34   });
 35   await deploy_txn.send().wait();
 36
 37   // get the initial state of Square after deployment
 38   const num0 = zkAppInstance.num.get();
 39   console.log('state after init:', num0.toString());
 40
 41   // ----------------------------------------------------
 42
 43   console.log('Shutting down')
 ...
```

The logic for creating a smart contract will be similar across any smart contract that is created.

Try running this now, with `npm run build; node build/src/main.js`. Output should be:
```
$ npm run build; node build/src/main.js
...
SnarkyJS loaded
state after init: 3
Shutting down
```

### Updating our contract with a transaction

Now let's try updating our contract with a transaction! Add the following:

```ts
...
 39   console.log('state after init:', num0.toString());
 40
 41   // ----------------------------------------------------
 42
 43   const txn1 = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
 44     zkAppInstance.update(Field.fromNumber(9));
 45     zkAppInstance.sign(zkAppPrivateKey);
 46   });
 47   await txn1.send().wait();
 48
 49   const num1 = zkAppInstance.num.get();
 50   console.log('state after txn1:', num1.toString());
 51
 52   // ----------------------------------------------------
 53
 54   console.log('Shutting down')
...
```

This code creates a new transaction - that attempts to update the field to the value `9`. As this follows the rules in the update function that we are calling on the smart contract, this should pass - and if you run it, it should!

```
...
SnarkyJS loaded
state after init: 3
state after txn1: 9
Shutting down
```

Now let's try adding a transaction that should fail - updating the state to `75`. Now that `num` is in state `9`, updating should only be possible with `81`.

```ts
...
  50   console.log('state after txn1:', num1.toString());
 51
 52   // ----------------------------------------------------
 53
 54   try {
 55     const txn2 = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
 56       zkAppInstance.update(Field.fromNumber(75));
 57       zkAppInstance.sign(zkAppPrivateKey);
 58     });
 59     await txn2.send().wait();
 60   } catch (ex: any) {
 61     console.log(ex.message);
 62   }
 63   const num2 = zkAppInstance.num.get();
 64   console.log('state after txn2:', num2.toString());
 65
 66   // ----------------------------------------------------
 67
 68   console.log('Shutting down')...
 ...
```

Running this now:
```
...
SnarkyJS loaded
state after init: 3
state after txn1: 9
assert_equal: 75 != 81
state after txn2: 9
Shutting down
```

And lastly, to show the correct update:

```ts
...
 64   console.log('state after txn2:', num2.toString());
 65
 66   // ----------------------------------------------------
 67
 68   const txn3 = await Mina.transaction(deployerAccount, () => {
 69     zkAppInstance.update(Field.fromNumber(81));
 70     zkAppInstance.sign(zkAppPrivateKey);
 71   });
 72   await txn3.send().wait();
 73
 74   const num3 = zkAppInstance.num.get();
 75   console.log('state after txn3:', num3.toString());
 76
 77   // ---------------------------------------
 78
 79   console.log('Shutting down')
 ...
```

With log from running:
```
...
SnarkyJS loaded
state after init: 3
state after txn1: 9
assert_equal: 75 != 81
state after txn2: 9
state after txn3: 81
Shutting down
```

## Conclusion

Congrats! We have finished building our first zkApp with SnarkyJS.
