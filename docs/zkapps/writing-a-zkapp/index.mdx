:::info

To protect end users and ensure your zkApps are secure, consider the information at [Security and zkApps](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/introduction-to-zkapps/secure-zkapps) while architecting your solution and consider a third-party security audit before deploying to Mina mainnet.

:::info

The maximum number of zkApp transactions per block is currently capped at **24**. This restriction will be gradually lifted after the Mainnet upgrade.

### What are zkApps?

zkApps (zero knowledge apps) are Mina Protocol smart contracts powered by zero knowledge proofs, specifically using zk-SNARKs.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This architecture allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

zkApps can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off-chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation. This cost saving benefit is in contrast to other blockchains that run computations on-chain and use a variable gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps. If you're new to using TypeScript, check out this helpful 12-min introductory video [TypeScript - The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM).

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what's possible:

    zkApps are a great fit for applications that require proof that you have a
    secret without revealing it to anyone.
