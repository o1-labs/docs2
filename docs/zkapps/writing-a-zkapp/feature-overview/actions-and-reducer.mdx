:::caution Warning
The reducer API in o1js is currently not safe to use in production applications. The `reduce()` method breaks if more than the hard-coded number (default: 32) of actions are pending. Work is actively in progress to mitigate this limitation.

When creating updates to unknown accounts in a reducer function, care should be taken to avoid introducing security vulnerabilities.

Please follow the guidelines [**here**](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/introduction-to-zkapps/secure-zkapps#best-practices-for-zkapp-security).

# Actions & Reducer

Like events, **actions** are _public_ arbitrary information that are passed along with a zkApp transaction. However, actions give you additional power: you can process previous actions in a smart contract! Under the hood, this is possible because a commitment is stored to the history of dispatched actions on every account -- the **actionState**. It allows you to prove that the actions you process are, in fact, the actions that were dispatched to the same smart contract.

Using actions and a "lagging state" pattern, you can write zkApps that can _process concurrent state updates by multiple users_. With this capability, you can imagine all kinds of use cases where actions act as a built-in, "append-only" off-chain storage layer.

To use actions, you first have to declare their type on the smart contract. The object to declare is called a **reducer** -- because it can take a list of actions and reduce them:

```ts
import { SmartContract, Reducer, Field } from 'o1js';

class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  reducer = Reducer({ actionType: Field });
}
```

Contrary to events, actions have only one type per smart contract. This type doesn't have a name. The `actionType` in this example is `Field`.

On a `reducer`, you have two functions: `reducer.dispatch()` and `reducer.reduce()`.

- "Dispatch" is simple -- like emitting events, it pushes one additional action to your account's action history:

  ```ts
  this.reducer.dispatch(Field(1000));
  ```

- "Reduce" is more involved, but it gives you full power to process actions however it suits your application. It might be easiest to grasp from an example where you have a list of actions and want to find out if one of actions is equal to `1000`.

In JavaScript, a built-in function on `Array` does this:

```ts
let has1000 = array.some((x) => x === 1000);
```

However, you can also implement this with `Array.reduce`:

```ts
let has1000 = array.reduce((acc, x) => acc || x === 1000, false);
```

In fact, `Array.reduce` is powerful enough to let you do pretty much all of the array processing you can think of.

With `Reducer.reduce`, an in-SNARK operation is just as powerful:

```ts
// type for the "accumulated output" of reduce -- the `stateType`
let stateType = Bool;

// example actions data
let actions = [[Field(1000)], [Field(2)], [Field(100)]];

// state before applying actions
let initial = {
  state: Bool(false),
};

let newState = this.reducer.reduce(
  actions,
  stateType,
  (state: Bool, action: Field) => state.or(action.equals(1000)),
  initial
);
```

The `acc` shown earlier is now `state`; you must pass in the state's type as a parameter and pass in an `actionState` which refers to one particular point in the action's history.

Like `Array.reduce`, `Reducer.reduce` takes a callback that has the signature `(state: State, action: Action) => State`, where `State` is the `stateType` and `Action` is the `actionType`. It returns the result of applying all the actions, in order, to the initial `state`. In this example, the returned `state` is `Bool(true)` because one of the actions in the list is `Field(1000)`. One last difference to JavaScript `reduce` is that it takes a _list of lists_ of actions, instead of a flat list. Each of the sublists are the actions that were dispatched in one account update (for example, while running one smart contract method).

As an astute reader, you might have noticed that this use of `state` is eerily similar to a standard "Elm architecture" that scans over an implicit infinite stream of actions (though here they are aggregated in chunks). This problem is familiar to web developers through its instantiation by using the Redux library or by using the `useReducer` hook in React.

There is one interesting nuance here when compared to traditional Elm Architecture/Redux/useReducer instantiations: Because multiple actions are handled concurrently in an undefined order, it is important that actions [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) against any possible state to prevent race conditions in your zkApp. Given any two actions a1 and a2 applying to some state s, `s * a1 * a2` means the same as `s * a2 * a1`.

A zkApp can retrieve events and actions from one or more Mina archive nodes. If your smart contract needs to fetch events and actions from an archive node, see [How to Fetch Events and Actions](fetch-events-and-actions).

### Reducer - API reference

```ts
reducer = Reducer({ actionType: FlexibleProvablePure<Action> });

this.reducer.dispatch(action: Action): void;

this.reducer.reduce<State>(
  actions: MerkleList<MerkleList<Action>>,
  stateType: Provable<State>,
  reduce: (state: State, action: Action) => State,
  initial: State,
  options?: {
    maxUpdatesWithActions?: number;
    maxActionsPerUpdate?: number;
    skipActionStatePrecondition?: boolean;
}
):  State;


```

The `getActions` function retrieves a list of previously emitted actions:

```ts
let pendingActions = this.reducer.getActions({ fromActionState?: Field, endActionState?: Field }): MerkleList<MerkleList<Action>>;
```
The final action state can be accessed on `pendingActions.hash`. 

```ts
let endActionState = pendingActions.hash;
```
If the optional `endActionState` parameter is provided, the list of actions will be fetched up to that state.
In that case, `pendingActions.hash` is guaranteed to equal `endActionState`.

Use `getActions` for testing with a simulated `LocalBlockchain`. See [Testing zkApps Locally](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp/introduction-to-zkapps/testing-zkapps-locally).

### Actions for concurrent state updates

One of the most important use cases for actions is to enable concurrent state updates. This enablement is also why actions were originally added to the protocol.

You can see a full code example in [reducer-composite.ts](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/examples/zkapps/reducer/reducer-composite.ts) that demonstrates this pattern. Leveraging `Reducer.reduce()`, it takes only about 30 lines of code to build a zkApp that handles concurrent state updates.
