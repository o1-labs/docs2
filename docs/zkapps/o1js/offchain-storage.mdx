# Offchain Storage

One of Mina's unique features is its succinctness, both in computation and storage. To prevent state bloat and maintain Mina's efficiency and verifiability, we use offchain storage solutions for handling large volumes of data.

In a previous section, we introduced the concept of On-chain Values. Since Mina currently supports only a total of 8 on-chain Field elements, we can leverage offchain storage to extend that capacity.
This approach maintains a provably secure connection between the on-chain smart contract and the off-chain data, such as that stored in an archive node.

## Design

Presently, Offchain storage offers support for two types of state: OffchainState.Field, representing a single field element, and OffchainState.Map, akin to the key-value maps found in JavaScript, like let myMap = new Map<string, number>();.

All offchain state resides within a single Merkle Map, which is essentially a wrapper around a [Merkle Tree](zkapps/o1js/merkle-tree.mdx). Practically speaking, there are no constraints on the number of state fields and maps that a developer can store in a smart contract using Offchain storage.

Under this framework, [Actions and Reducer](zkapps/o1js/actions-and-reducer.mdx) are utilized to manage state changes, with actions dispatching state updates and reducers settling them. Additionally, a Merkle Tree is employed to maintain a provably secure commitment to the data, with the root stored on-chain.

Prior to users accessing published state, it must first undergo settlement. Thanks to the design of Offchain storage, all state is recoverable from actions alone, eliminating the need for additional events or external data storage.

## Utilizing Offchain Storage

### Setting up Offchain Storage

To integrate Offchain storage, developers must initially define an Offchain state configuration and a state proof type, then prepare the smart contract. The `OffchainState` configuration allows specification of the desired Offchain state type, including key-value pairs in a map and any additional required state.

The `StateProof` type will subsequently be used to finalize published state changes using a recursive reducer.

```ts
const offchainState = OffchainState({
  players: OffchainState.Map(PublicKey, UInt64),
  totalScore: OffchainState.Field(UInt64),
});

class StateProof extends offchainState.Proof {}
```

Developers also need to set the smart contract instance and assign it to the offchain storage.
This also compiles the recursive Offchain zkProgram in the background and assigns the Offchain state to a smart contract instance.

```ts
let contract = new MyContract(contractAddress);
offchainState.setContractInstance(contract);

// compile Offchain state program
await offchainState.compile();
// compile smart contract
await ExampleContract.compile();
```

When the offchain state requires settlement, an Offchain storage proof must be generated and provided to the smart contract's `settle()` method. This method automatically retrieves all pending actions (state changes) and resolves them using a recursive reducer.
Finally, the proof is passed to the `settle()` method.

```ts
let proof = await offchainState.createSettlementProof();

await Mina.transaction(sender, () => {
  // settle all outstanding state changes
  contract.settle(proof);
})
  .sign([sender.key])
  .prove()
  .send();
```

### Configuring Your Smart Contract

The smart contract requires a field indicating the previously defined commitment to the offchain state. This field allows accessing offchain state similar to any other on-chain value.

```ts
class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  @state(OffchainStateCommitments) offchainState = State(
    OffchainStateCommitments.empty()
  );
}
```

The contract also need a `settle()` method to resolve all pending state updates. This method verifies a recursive proof to finalize all pending state changes, with the proof being generated before invoking the `settle()` method.

```ts
class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  // ...
  @method
  async settle(proof: StateProof) {
    await offchainState.settle(proof);
  }
}
```

**It is important to mention that state is only available after it was settled via `settle()`!**

### Utilizing Offchain Storage

Now developers can utilize Offchain storage in any of their smart contract methods, as demonstrated below:

```ts
class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  // ...
  @method
  async useOffchainStorage(playerA: PublicKey) {
    let totalScore = await offchainState.fields.totalScore.get(); // retrieve totalScore
    offchainState.fields.totalScore.set(totalScore.add(1)); // increment totalScore

    let playerOption = await offchainState.fields.players.get(playerA); // retrieve an entry from the map, returning an Option
    let score = playerOption.orElse(0n); // unwrap the player's score Option and return a default value if the entry is empty
  }
}
```

Currently, Offchain storage types of Field support `field.get()` and `field.set(newValue)`, while maps support `map.get(key)` and `map.set(key, newValue)`.
