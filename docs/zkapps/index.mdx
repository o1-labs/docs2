Please note that zkApp programmability is not yet available on Mina Mainnet, but
zkApps can now be deployed to Berkeley Testnet.

### What are zkApps?

zkApps ("zero-knowledge apps") are Mina Protocol’s smart contracts powered by zero-knowledge proofs, specifically using zk-SNARKs.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

zkApps can perform arbitrarily-complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain for verification of this computation, as opposed to other blockchains that run computations on chain and use a variable gas-fee based model.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps. If you're new to using TypeScript, check out this helpful [12-min introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM).

See [How to Write a zkApp](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp) page to learn more.

### Quickstart

Deploy a zkApp in 5-steps, to see how easy it is to get started:

1. `npm install -g zkapp-cli` (This will make the `zk` command available on your system.)
2. `zk project <name>`
3. `cd <name>`
4. `zk config`

   Enter the details below when prompted:

   - Name: `berkeley` (can be anything)
   - URL: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
   - Fee: `0.1`

   When finished, hold command (Mac) or control (Windows & Linux) and click the URL shown in your terminal to request Testnet MINA on your address from https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/?address=yourAddress. Then wait ~3min for the next block so you'll have Testnet MINA to send your deploy transaction.

5. `zk deploy berkeley`

The project you just created contains an example smart
contract named `Add.ts` that stores a number as on-chain state and adds `2` to it
whenever a transaction is received by the zkApp account.

You just deployed a zkApp!

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what’s possible:

    zkApps are a great fit for applications that require proof that you have a
    secret without revealing it to anyone.
