```ts
function OffchainState<Config>(config: Config, options?: {
  "logTotalCapacity": number;
  "maxActionsPerProof": number;
  "maxActionsPerUpdate": number;
}): OffchainState<Config>
```

Offchain state for a `SmartContract`.

```ts
// declare your offchain state

const offchainState = OffchainState({
  accounts: OffchainState.Map(PublicKey, UInt64),
  totalSupply: OffchainState.Field(UInt64),
});

// use it in a contract, by adding an onchain state field of type `OffchainStateCommitments`

class MyContract extends SmartContract {
 \@state(OffchainStateCommitments) offchainState = State(
   OffchainStateCommitments.empty()
  );

  // ...
}

// set the contract instance

let contract = new MyContract(address);
offchainState.setContractInstance(contract);
```

See the individual methods on `offchainState` for more information on usage.

## Type parameters

• **Config** *extends* \{\}

## Parameters

• **config**: `Config`

• **options?**

• **options.logTotalCapacity?**: `number`

The base-2 logarithm of the total capacity of the offchain state.

Example: if you want to have 1 million individual state fields and map entries available,
set this to 20, because 2^20 ~= 1M.

The default is 30, which allows for ~1 billion entries.

Passing in lower numbers will reduce the number of constraints required to prove offchain state updates,
which we will make proof creation slightly faster.
Instead, you could also use a smaller total capacity to increase the `maxActionsPerProof`, so that fewer proofs are required,
which will reduce the proof time even more, but only in the case of many actions.

• **options.maxActionsPerProof?**: `number`

• **options.maxActionsPerUpdate?**: `number`

The maximum number of offchain state actions that can be included in a single account update.

In other words, you must not call `.update()` or `.overwrite()` more than this number of times in any of your smart contract methods.

The default is 4.

Note: When increasing this, consider decreasing `maxActionsPerProof` or `logTotalCapacity` in order to not exceed the circuit size limit.

## Returns

`OffchainState`\<`Config`\>
