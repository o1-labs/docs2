```ts
type PendingTransaction: Pick<TransactionCommon, "transaction" | "toJSON" | "toPretty"> & {
  "data": SendZkAppResponse;
  "errors": string[];
  "hash": string;
  "status": PendingTransactionStatus;
  "safeWait": Promise<RejectedTransaction | IncludedTransaction>;
  "wait": Promise<IncludedTransaction>;
};
```

Represents a transaction that has been submitted to the blockchain but has not yet reached a final state.
The [PendingTransaction](PendingTransaction.mdx) type extends certain functionalities from the base [Transaction](Transaction.mdx) type,
adding methods to monitor the transaction's progress towards being finalized (either included in a block or rejected).

## Type declaration

### data?

```ts
optional data: SendZkAppResponse;
```

Optional. Contains response data from a ZkApp transaction submission.

### errors

```ts
errors: string[];
```

An array of error messages related to the transaction processing.

#### Example

```ts
if (!pendingTransaction.status === 'rejected') {
  console.error(`Transaction errors: ${pendingTransaction.errors.join(', ')}`);
}
```

### hash

```ts
hash: string;
```

Returns the transaction hash as a string identifier.

#### Example

```ts
const txHash = pendingTransaction.hash;
console.log(`Transaction hash: ${txHash}`);
```

### status

```ts
status: PendingTransactionStatus;
```

#### Example

```ts
if (pendingTransaction.status === 'pending') {
  console.log('Transaction accepted for processing by the Mina daemon.');
  try {
    await pendingTransaction.wait();
    console.log('Transaction successfully included in a block.');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Transaction was rejected or failed to be included in a block:', error);
  }
} else {
  console.error('Transaction was not accepted for processing by the Mina daemon.');
}
```

### safeWait()

Waits for the transaction to be included in a block. This method polls the Mina daemon to check the transaction's status

#### Parameters

• **options?**

Configuration options for polling behavior.

• **options.interval?**: `number`

The time interval, in milliseconds, between each polling attempt.

• **options.maxAttempts?**: `number`

The maximum number of polling attempts.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`RejectedTransaction`](RejectedTransaction.mdx) \| [`IncludedTransaction`](IncludedTransaction.mdx)\>

A promise that resolves to the transaction's final state.

#### Example

```ts
const transaction = await pendingTransaction.wait({ maxAttempts: 5, interval: 1000 });
console.log(transaction.status); // 'included' or 'rejected'
```

### wait()

Waits for the transaction to be included in a block. This method polls the Mina daemon to check the transaction's status, and throws an error if the transaction is rejected.

#### Parameters

• **options?**

Configuration options for polling behavior.

• **options.interval?**: `number`

The interval, in milliseconds, between status checks.

• **options.maxAttempts?**: `number`

The maximum number of attempts to check the transaction status.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`IncludedTransaction`](IncludedTransaction.mdx)\>

A promise that resolves to the transaction's final state or throws an error.

#### Throws

If the transaction is rejected or fails to finalize within the given attempts.

#### Example

```ts
try {
  const transaction = await pendingTransaction.wait({ maxAttempts: 10, interval: 2000 });
  console.log('Transaction included in a block.');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Transaction rejected or failed to finalize:', error);
}
```
