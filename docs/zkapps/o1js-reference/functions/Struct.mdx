```ts
function Struct<A, T, V, J, Pure>(type: A): (value: T) => T & {
  "_isStruct": true;
 } & Pure extends true ? ProvablePure<T, V> : Provable<T, V> & {
  "empty": () => T;
  "fromJSON": (x: J) => T;
  "fromValue": (value: From<A>) => T;
  "toInput": (x: T) => {
     "fields": Field[];
     "packed": [Field, number][];
    };
  "toJSON": (x: T) => J;
}
```

`Struct` lets you declare composite types for use in o1js circuits.

These composite types can be passed in as arguments to smart contract methods, used for on-chain state variables
or as event / action types.

Here's an example of creating a "Voter" struct, which holds a public key and a collection of votes on 3 different proposals:
```ts
let Vote = { hasVoted: Bool, inFavor: Bool };

class Voter extends Struct({
  publicKey: PublicKey,
  votes: [Vote, Vote, Vote]
}) {}

// use Voter as SmartContract input:
class VoterContract extends SmartContract {
  \@method register(voter: Voter) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
In this example, there are no instance methods on the class. This makes `Voter` type-compatible with an anonymous object of the form
`{ publicKey: PublicKey, votes: Vote[] }`.
This mean you don't have to create instances by using `new Voter(...)`, you can operate with plain objects:
```ts
voterContract.register({ publicKey, votes });
```

On the other hand, you can also add your own methods:
```ts
class Voter extends Struct({
  publicKey: PublicKey,
  votes: [Vote, Vote, Vote]
}) {
  vote(index: number, inFavor: Bool) {
    let vote = this.votes[i];
    vote.hasVoted = Bool(true);
    vote.inFavor = inFavor;
  }
}
```

In this case, you'll need the constructor to create instances of `Voter`. It always takes as input the plain object:
```ts
let emptyVote = { hasVoted: Bool(false), inFavor: Bool(false) };
let voter = new Voter({ publicKey, votes: Array(3).fill(emptyVote) });
voter.vote(1, Bool(true));
```

In addition to creating types composed of Field elements, you can also include auxiliary data which does not become part of the proof.
This, for example, allows you to re-use the same type outside o1js methods, where you might want to store additional metadata.

To declare non-proof values of type `string`, `number`, etc, you can use the built-in objects `String`, `Number`, etc.
Here's how we could add the voter's name (a string) as auxiliary data:
```ts
class Voter extends Struct({
  publicKey: PublicKey,
  votes: [Vote, Vote, Vote],
  fullName: String
}) {}
```

Again, it's important to note that this doesn't enable you to prove anything about the `fullName` string.
From the circuit point of view, it simply doesn't exist!

## Type parameters

• **A**

• **T** *extends* `unknown` = [`InferProvable`](../type-aliases/InferProvable.mdx)\<`A`\>

• **V** *extends* `unknown` = `InferValue`\<`A`\>

• **J** *extends* `unknown` = `InferJson`\<`A`\>

• **Pure** *extends* `boolean` = `IsPure`\<`A`\>

## Parameters

• **type**: `A`

Object specifying the layout of the `Struct`

## Returns

(`value`: `T`) => `T` & \{
  `"_isStruct"`: `true`;
 \} & `Pure` *extends* `true` ? [`ProvablePure`](../type-aliases/ProvablePure.mdx)\<`T`, `V`\> : `Provable`\<`T`, `V`\> & \{
  `"empty"`: () => `T`;
  `"fromJSON"`: (`x`: `J`) => `T`;
  `"fromValue"`: (`value`: `From`\<`A`\>) => `T`;
  `"toInput"`: (`x`: `T`) => \{
     `"fields"`: [`Field`](../type-aliases/Field.mdx)[];
     `"packed"`: [[`Field`](../type-aliases/Field.mdx), `number`][];
    \};
  `"toJSON"`: (`x`: `T`) => `J`;
 \}

Class which you can extend

## Note

Ensure you do not use or extend `Struct` as a type directly. Instead, always call it as a function to construct a type. `Struct` is not a valid provable type itself, types created with `Struct(...)` are.
