# Time-Locked Accounts

Time-locking allows you to pay someone in MINA or custom other tokens subject to a vesting schedule. This means that the tokens are initially locked, and only become available for withdrawal after a certain time, or gradually according to a certain schedule.

The zkApp feature that enables time-locking is the `timing` field, which is present on every account. It look like this:

```ts
type Account = {
  // ...
  timing: {
    isTimed: Bool;
    initialMinimumBalance: UInt64;
    cliffTime: UInt32;
    cliffAmount: UInt64;
    vestingPeriod: UInt32;
    vestingIncrement: UInt64;
  };
};
```

`isTimed` indicates whether this account is time locked. The other fields are parameters that allow us to define a vesting schedule in a very flexible manner. We will explain them in detail below. By default, accounts are not time locked, and `isTimed` will be `false` and all other properties will contain default values.

This graph shows how each of the timing properties affect the vesting schedule:

</figure>

The red cross on the left marks the point in time where the `timing` field is set and `isTimed` switches from `false` to `true`. The orange line shows how the amount of unlocked tokens increases over time, until it finally reaches its maximum value and stays flat. At this point, `isTimed` flips from `true` back to `false`, because no tokens remain locked.

As you can see, the maximum amount of unlocked tokens is defined by the `initialMinimumBalance`. It is called "initialMinimumBalance" because, even though the tokens show up in the balance, they can't be withdrawn — in other words, the account has a a non-zero _minimum balance_. Initially, that minimum balance is equal to the amount of tokens locked (i.e. the initial minimum balance). Over time, the minimum balance decreases until it hits zero, which is the condition that makes `isTimed` false again.

The other timing-related properties are described as follows:

- `cliffTime`: the initial time period during which all tokens are locked. Note that 'time' is measured in Mina by 'slots', where 1 slot is 3min currently.
- `cliffAmount`: the quantity of tokens to be unlocked when the cliff time has elapsed. If this is greater or equal the 'initial minimum balance', all tokens will be unlocked after the cliff time elapses.
- `vestingPeriod`: After the cliff time elapses, tokens can be set to unlock periodically at a fixed interval, by a fixed quantity. The vesting period is the length of that interval.
- `vestingIncrement`: the quantity of tokens unlocked after each vesting period elapses.

:::note
Only one vesting schedule can be specified per account and it cannot be changed during the vesting period.

Because of this, when `isTimed` is set to `true`, the values of the timing fields are immutable and cannot be changed.
After all tokens are unlocked and `isTimed` flips back to `false`, the account timing will become mutable again.

### Setting timing in SnarkyJS

In SnarkyJS, `timing` is one of the account fields that can be updated by using an account update:

```ts
accountUpdate.account.timing.set({ initialMinimumBalance, cliffTime, ...etc });
```

When setting this, all timing-related properties are required, except for `isTimed`, which will be set by the protocol automatically.

### Examples

Let's see how to correctly implement some simple example use cases.

#### Example 1: All tokens unlock after 1 week

If you simply want all tokens to unlock after a certain time, then the only properties you need to care about are `initialMinimumBalance`, `cliffTime`, and `cliffAmount`. We'll set `cliffAmount` equal to the `initialMinimumBalance` to ensure all tokens are unlocked when the cliff elapses. Both `vestingPeriod` and `vestingIncrement` are unused so we'll set them to their default values, 1 and 0:

```ts
// example: 10 MINA to lock
const tokensToLock = UInt64.from(10e9);

// calculate 1 week in slots
const cliffTime = UInt32.from((60 / 3) * 24 * 7);

accountUpdate.account.timing.set({
  initialMinimumBalance: tokensToLock,
  cliffTime,
  cliffAmount: tokensToLock,
  vestingPeriod: UInt32.from(1), // 0 is not allowed; default value is 1
  vestingIncrement: UInt64.from(0),
});

this.send({ to: accountUpdate, amount: tokensToLock });
```

#### Example 2: Linear vesting over 1 year

In this example, we won't use a cliff, we just want a certain number of tokens to vest linearly over 1 year. To do this, we set the `vestingPeriod` to equivalent to 1 month defined in slots, so that new tokens will be unlocked every month. The `vestingIncrement` is set to the total amount divided by 12, so that the total amount will be unlocked after 12 months. Both `cliffTime` and `cliffAmount` can just be set to 0.

```ts
// example: 100000 MINA to lock
const tokensToLock = UInt64.from(100000e9);

// calculate 1 month in slots
const vestingPeriod = UInt32.from(Math.round(((60 / 3) * 24 * 365) / 12));

// 1/12th of tokens unlocked every month
const vestingIncrement = UInt64.from(Math.round(tokensToLock / 12));

accountUpdate.account.timing.set({
  initialMinimumBalance: tokensToLock,
  cliffTime: UInt32.from(0),
  cliffAmount: UInt64.from(0),
  vestingPeriod,
  vestingIncrement,
});

this.send({ to: accountUpdate, amount: tokensToLock });
```
