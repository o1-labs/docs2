# Reporting Issues, Bugs, & Feature Requests


## How to report things on Mina

If you notice a bug, issue, or missing feature, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Search existing issues

Before making a report, first search through [existing issues](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues) to see if something similar has been reported.

### 2. Found a bug?

If your issue is a bug, related to the Mina website, or you have feedback about user experience, you can report it on the [Mina Protocol repo on Github](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues/new/choose).

### 3. Found a vulnerability?

If your issue is a vulnerability that may be putting other people’s funds at risk or related to the protocol infrastructure, please report the issue via Mina’s Bounty Program at [hackerone.com/o1-labs](https://hackerone.com/o1-labs).

### 4. Found an urgent issue?

If your issue is time-sensitive that needs immediate attention, please send more details and your contact information to security@o1labs.org. A member of Mina’s engineering team will reach out promptly.
