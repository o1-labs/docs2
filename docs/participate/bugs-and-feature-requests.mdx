# Reporting Issues, Bugs, & Feature Requests


## How to report things on Mina

If you notice a bug, issue, or missing feature, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Search existing issues

Before making a report, first search through [existing issues](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues) to see if something similar has been reported.

### 2. Found a bug?

If your issue is a bug, related to the Mina website or you have feedback about user experience, you can report it on the [Mina Protocol repo on GitHub](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues/new/choose).

### 3. Found a vulnerability?

If your issue is a vulnerability that may be putting other people's funds at risk or is related to the protocol infrastructure, the first step is to report the issue on the [Mina Protocol repo on GitHub](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/issues/new/choose).
