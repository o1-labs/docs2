# Exchange Operators

Exchange operators are network participants who run Mina nodes on a Mina network but usually don't produce blocks.

Instead of running a Mina node and an archive node, use the Rosetta API that is designed specifically for exchange operators.

It implements an [open-source blockchain-agnostic specification](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/welcome) designed by Coinbase.

## Rosetta API

This section describes how to install, run and use the Rosetta API instance connected to the Mina network.

Use Rosetta API if you are:
- Querying historical data from the Mina blockchain
- Integrating the Mina blockchain with your exchange
- Building blockchain applications, such as explorers and wallets

Using Rosetta for building your application is preferable, as it's API is more appropriate for applications and far more stable than GraphQL.
