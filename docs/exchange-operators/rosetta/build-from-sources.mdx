# Building and running Rosetta from source code

In [Running with Docker](run-with-docker), you learned that the Docker container runs the mina daemon, mina-archive, and Rosetta API. 

If you already have mina-archive up and running, you can also build and run the Rosetta API natively and wire it to the existing mina daemon and mina-archive.

:::tip

To run mina daemon and mina-archive natively, follow the [Archive Node page](node-operators/archive-node) instructions.

:::

The easiest way to build Rosetta natively is to use the Nix development environment.

1. Clone the official [mina repository](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina.git) and switch to the `compatible` branch.

2. If you don't already have Nix on your machine, install it following the steps in the [nix/README.md](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/blob/develop/nix/README.md).

3. Run the `./nix/pin.sh` script to enable submodules to be available to the build:


    ./nix/pin.sh


4. Launch the development shell:


    nix develop mina


5. Build Rosetta app:


    dune build --profile=mainnet src/app/rosetta


6. After a successful build, the Rosetta app is available here: `_build/default/src/app/rosetta/rosetta.exe` 

You can run it with following command:

    MINA_ROSETTA_MAX_DB_POOL_SIZE=64 MINA_ROSETTA_NETWORK=mainnet \
        _build/default/src/app/rosetta/rosetta.exe --port 3087 \
        --graphql-uri <URL to Mina GraphQL instance> 
        --archive-uri postgres://<username>:<password>@m<host>:<port>/<db_name>
