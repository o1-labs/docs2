:::info
This flow is also described in the [Construction API Overview](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/construction-api-overview) article in the official Rosetta documentation.
:::

The steps needed to send payment in MINA token are following:
1. Given a key pair, derive the account identifier using `/construction/derive` endpoint
1. Call `/construction/preprocess` and `/construction/metadata` to construct parameters for `/construction/payloads` request
1. Create an unsigned transaction blob using `construction/payloads` endpoint
1. Call `construction/parse` (optional) to check if the unsigned transaction does what you expect
1. Use detached signer to sign the transaction
1. Call `construction/combine` to generate signed blob to be sent via `/construction/submit` endpoint
1. Call `construction/parse` again (optional) to confirm correctness of the signed transaction
1. Get a future transaction hash using `/construction/hash` endpoint
1. Submit the signed transaction blob via `/construction/submit` endpoint

For ease of readability, this sample implementation skips the sanity checks (steps 4 and 7) and combines steps 2 and 3 in a single `tx_payloads` function call.

Before running this sample:
- Make sure you followed [Offline signer tool](using-signer) article and generated a key pair
- Send some test funds on the account you've generated.

The implementation is as follows:

<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
async function send(privateKey: string, to: string, valueNano: number, feeNano: number) {
  const publicKey = mina.derivePublicKey(privateKey)
  const publicKeyRaw = mina.publicKeyToRaw(publicKey)
  // get transfer payload to sign
  const payloadsResponse = await txPayloads(
    publicKeyRaw,
    publicKey,
    to,
    feeNano,
    valueNano,
  )

  // sign and combine transfer payload
  const combineResponse = await txCombine(payloadsResponse, privateKey)
  const blob = combineResponse.signed_transaction

  // // get future transaction hash
  const txHashResponse = await txHash(blob)
  const hash = txHashResponse.transaction_identifier.hash

  // submit transaction. this call will fail if tx is not in mempool
  await txSubmit(blob)
  // wait for transaction confirmation:
  // for that, track blocks until we meet our transaction in the last one
  let latestBlock = (await networkStatus()).current_block_identifier.index
  while (true) {
    // check if our transaction exists in the latest block
    const txs = (await waitForBlock(latestBlock)).block.transactions
    const hashes = txs.map((tx: any) => tx.transaction_identifier.hash)
    if (hashes.includes(hash)) {
      break
    }

    latestBlock += 1
  }
  return hash
}
```
