description: Learn how to track deposits on the given address

After everything is ready, you can implement deposit tracking.

For that, iterate through all transactions in each block to search for `payment_receiver_inc` operation with an address matching the address in which you are interested:


```python
def deposit_flow(deposit_address):
    # some logic we want to execute on deposit
    def on_deposit(deposit):
        pprint_json(deposit)
    
    latest_block = network_status()["current_block_identifier"]["index"]
    while True:
        # check if transactions to the deposit address are present in the latest block
        txs = wait_for_block(latest_block)['block']['transactions']
        deposits = []
        for tx in txs:
            for op in tx["operations"]:
                if op["account"]["address"] == deposit_address \
                        and op["type"] == "payment_receiver_inc":
                    deposits.append({
                        "tx_hash": tx["transaction_identifier"]["hash"],
                        "amount": op["amount"]["value"]
                    })
        
        # process deposits
        for d in deposits:
            on_deposit(d)

        latest_block += 1
```
