This Delegation Program is an implementation of the Mina Foundation Delegation Policy, the official policy on the delegations of MINA tokens from the Mina Foundation (referred to as “Foundation” below).

If you are a block producer looking to participate in the Mina Foundation Delegation Program, this page explains how the program works and how to send uptime data and pay back rewards.

:::note

There are two delegation programs in Mina's ecosystem — one from the Mina Foundation and [one from o1Labs](https://www.o1labs.org/blog/delegation-policy-2024#o1labs-delegation-program-policy), Mina's ecosystem partner. This page details the program only for the Mina Foundation.

## Overview

Mina Foundation is committed to decentralizing the governance of the Mina protocol. In order to delegate their voting power, Mina Foundation delegates its tokens to community members through the [Mina Foundation Delegation Program](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/mina-foundation-delegation-policy).

In the Delegation Program, Mina Foundation delegates its tokens to a number of validators. As the validators earn staking rewards associated with the delegation, they must return the remaining rewards to Mina Foundation, but can keep 8% of the staking rewards.

Block producers are selected on a quarterly basis, known as a delegation cycle, based on their Performance Scores (see below) and requirements outlined in the [Mina Foundation Delegation Policy](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/mina-foundation-delegation-policy).
