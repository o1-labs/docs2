# Introduction

The [Mina Protocol](/mina-protocol) is a layer 1 blockchain that is secured by [proof of stake consensus](/mina-protocol/proof-of-stake).

There are three public Mina Protocol networks:

1. `mainnet`  - the production network
2. `devnet`   - the test network based on the same software versions as the mainnet
3. `izmir`    - a development network where new features are trialed

You check the identity of the network with this graphQL query:

```
query MyQuery {
  networkID
}
```


## Node Operators

Node operators are network participants who run mina nodes on a Mina network.

This section describes operations on Mina and how node operators can run Mina nodes.

## Mina Nodes

A node is a machine running the Mina daemon. Different nodes fulfill different roles within the Mina network:

1. [Block Producer](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/glossary#block-producer) - A node that participates in a process to determine what blocks it is allowed to produce and then produces blocks containing transactions that can be broadcast to the network. People who run [block producer](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/mina-protocol/block-producers) nodes are also called block producers.

2. [SNARK Coordinators](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/glossary#snark-coordinator) - A role on a Mina node in the Mina network that distributes work to a series of SNARK workers in parallel to block production.

3. [SNARK Workers](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/glossary#snark-worker) -  SNARK workers create [zk-SNARKs](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/what-are-zk-snarks) for each transaction. These zk-SNARKs are used to create recursive zk-SNARKs that prove the correctness of a block, and in turn, these zk-SNARKs are used to create recursive zk-SNARKs that prove the correctness of the network. These zk-SNARKs help provide the Mina Protocol with succinctness. 

4. [Archive Nodes](/node-operators/archive-node) - A regular mina daemon that is connected to a running `mina-archive` process. The daemon regularly sends blockchain data to the archive process that stores it in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

5. [Seed Nodes](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/glossary#seed-nodes) - Keep a record of nodes in the network and enable nodes joining the network to connect to peer nodes.
