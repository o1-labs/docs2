# Requirements

## Hardware Requirements

Please note the following are the hardware requirements for each node type after the upgrade:

| Node Type | Memory | CPU | Storage | Network |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Mina Daemon Node | 32 GB RAM | 8 core processor with BMI2 and AVX CPU instruction set are required | 64 GB | 1 Mbps Internet Connection |
| SNARK Coordinator | 32 GB RAM | 8 core processor | 64 GB | 1 Mbps Internet Connection |
| SNARK Worker | 32 GB RAM | 4 core/8 threads per worker with BMI2 and AVX CPU instruction set are required | 64 GB | 1 Mbps Internet Connection |
| Archive Node | 32 GB RAM | 8 core processor | 64 GB | 1 Mbps Internet Connection |
| Rosetta API standalone Docker image | 32 GB RAM | 8 core processor | 64 GB | 1 Mbps Internet Connection |
| Mina Seed Node | 64 GB RAM | 8 core processor | 64 GB | 1 Mbps Internet Connection |

## Mina Daemon Requirements

### IP and Port configuration​

**IP:**

By default, the Mina Daemon will attempt to retrieve its public IP address from the system. If you are running the node behind a NAT or firewall, you can set the `--external-ip` flag to specify the public IP address.

**Port:**

Nodes must expose a port publicly to communicate with other peers.
Mina uses by default the port `8302` which is the default libp2p port.

You can use a different port by setting the `--external-port` flag.

### Node Auto-restart

Ensure your nodes are set to restart automatically after a crash. For guidance, refer to the [auto-restart instructions](/node-operators/block-producer-node/connecting-to-the-network#start-a-mina-node-with-auto-restart-flows-using-systemd)
