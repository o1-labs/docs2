# Mina CLI Reference

The Mina CLI command line interface is the primary way for users to interact with the Mina network. It provides standard client functionality to create accounts, send transactions, and participate in consensus. There are also advanced client and daemon commands for power users.

The Mina CLI is installed when you [install Mina](/node-operators/getting-started#installation).

:::warning

Mina APIs are always improving. See `mina help` for the most up-to-date version.
