# Mina Overview

## What is Mina?

Mina is an L1 blockchain based on zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) with smart contracts written in TypeScript. It is the first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain (22KB).

## Why Mina?

The Mina Protocol is a native ZK blockchain, but what does this mean? The Mina Protocol is a layer 1 blockchain built to use zero knowledge proofs. The Mina Protocol uses zk-SNARKS.

Some advantages of this approach are:

- A succinct blockchain that facilitates decentralization. The lightweight design allows a node to sync faster and reduces both storage and bandwidth requirements for [node operators](../node-operators).
- Zero knowledge proofs are used to secure the blockchain. Using recursive zk-Snarks, the blockchain remains a constant size — about 22KB.
- Client side code execution, zkApps run code on the client, helping to scale blockchian technology. Client side code execution generates zk-SNARKS (proofs) to prove correct execution. Transactions send these proofs to the blockchain and are verified on-chain.
- Privacy by default, protect your data using zero knowledge proofs.

## What are zero knowledge proofs?

Mina's unique characteristics are made possible using zero knowledge proofs.

## What are zkApps?

Mina's zero knowledge smart contracts, known as zkApps, offer distinct features, including off-chain proving, extensive off-chain execution capabilities, on-chain verification, privacy for confidential data (private inputs, by default, are not sent to the blockchain), the option to code smart contracts in TypeScript, and additional functionalities.

See [zkApps Overview](/zkapps/writing-a-zkapp).

## How does consensus work on Mina?

The Mina network is secured by proof of stake (PoS) consensus called Ouroboros Samisika.

Based on Cardano's Ouroboros, Ouroboros Samisika is a PoS consensus mechanism that requires far less computing power than Bitcoin's proof of work (PoW) protocol.

With this model of Mina's [consensus mechanism](/about-mina/consensus), you don't need expensive and energy-consuming mining equipment to participate in consensus. By simply holding MINA in your wallet, you can choose to stake it yourself by running a [block producer](/mina-protocol/block-producers) node or delegate your MINA to another node.
