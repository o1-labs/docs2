# Consensus

Mina Protocol uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called **Ouroboros Samasika**. 

Consensus is the process by which the network determines which information will be retained in the blockchain. You can read about the difference between <a href="https://minaprotocol.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake"> proof of stake (PoS) vs proof of work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanisms.

### Decentralization properties
Based on Cardano’s PoS Ouroboros, Ouroboros Samisika is a secure PoS protocol with some strong decentralization properties: 

- Can resolve long-range forks without relying on third parties to provide history
- **No staking minimum** — You can produce blocks and receive block rewards based on your % of the MINA staked on the network. Any user with any amount of MINA can receive these rewards.
- **No slashing** — the protocol does not need explicit slashing, since the protocol already enforces the required level of correctness.
