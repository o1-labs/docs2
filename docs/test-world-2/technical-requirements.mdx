# Testworld Mission 2.0 Protocol Performance Testing
The Testworld Mission 2.0: Protocol Performance Testing program is here. The goal of this program is to stress test the protocol and network with Mina community members to have a high level of confidence for Mina’s upcoming mainnet upgrade that will enable easier zkApps on Mina Mainnet.

The Program gathers experienced node operators to provide the network backbone for the Testworld 2.0 testnet. Participants will perform various node operation testing tasks for different grants. Participants can perform multiple node operation tasks.

## Technical Requirements

| 16/32 thread dedicated instance  | 16 GB RAM   | 20 GB free storage | 1 Mbps internet connection | 

<br />

:::note

Multiple SNARK Worker processes should run on the same SNARK Work server. 4 core/8 threads should be provisioned per SNARK worker process, giving a total of 4 workers per SNARK Work server.

All your SNARK Worker processes should connect to your SNARK Coordinator.
