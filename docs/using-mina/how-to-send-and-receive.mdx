<Subhead>
Learn how to send and receive MINA
</Subhead>


### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have [installed a Mina wallet](../using-mina/install-a-wallet).

### Receiving MINA

To receive MINA, you must provide the unique address for your Mina account to the sender.

Here’s how to find your address within common wallets:

- [**Auro**](https://www.aurowallet.com) - Open the wallet, tap “*Receive*”, and tap “*Copy*” to share your address or QR code representing this address.
- [**Clorio Wallet**](https://clor.io) - Open the wallet and tap <img src="/img/Copy_icon.png" alt="Copy icon on Clor.io" width="3%"/> at the top to copy your address.
- [**Staking Power**](https://www.staking-power.com) - Open the wallet, tap “Receive”, and tap <img src="/img/Copy_icon_2.png" alt="Copy icon on Staking Power" width="3%"/> or “*Share*” to copy your address or QR code representing this address.
- [**Ledger Hardware Wallet**](https://www.ledger.com/mina-wallet) - Follow the [instructions on creating a Ledger Mina account via Auro Wallet](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/5458493215901-Creating-a-Ledger-MINA-account-via-Auro-Wallet?docs=true), then see the instructions for receiving MINA on Auro wallet above.

:::note

To prevent spam, the Mina network charges a one-time account creation fee of 1 MINA. This fee is automatically deducted from the first transaction received.

### Sending MINA
When sending MINA, always double check that you have the correct Mina address for the recipient.  Remember that <i>transactions on the Mina blockchain are final and irreversible</i>.

- [**Clorio Wallet**](https://clor.io) - Open the wallet, tap “*Send TX*”, and enter in the address, memo, amount, and fee, tap “*Preview*”, and enter in the nonce then tap “*Confirm*”.
- [**Staking Power**](https://www.staking-power.com) - Open wallet, tap “*Send*”, enter in the address and memo (optional), tap “*Continue*”, enter in the amount, tap “*Continue*”, and “*Confirm*”.
- [**Ledger Hardware Wallet**](https://www.ledger.com/mina-wallet) - Follow the [instructions on creating a Ledger Mina account via Auro Wallet](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/5458493215901-Creating-a-Ledger-MINA-account-via-Auro-Wallet?docs=true), then see the instructions for sending MINA on Auro wallet above.

:::note

When sending transactions on a blockchain, such as Mina, senders must include a transaction fee. Most wallets calculate a recommended fee. You can also view a suggested fee amount based on current network transaction volume at this community-created [Gas Station website](https://fees.mina.tools/).

:::

### Viewing your transction on a blockchain explorer

You can view your transactions using one of the community-run blockchain explorers:
- [Mina Explorer](https://minaexplorer.com/)
- [Minascan](https://minascan.io/)
