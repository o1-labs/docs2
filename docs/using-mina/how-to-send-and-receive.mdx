# How to Send & Receive

<Subhead>
Learn how to send and receive MINA
</Subhead>


### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have [installed a Mina wallet](../using-mina/install-a-wallet).

### Receiving MINA

To receive MINA, you must provide the unique address for your Mina account to the sender.

Here’s how to find your address within common wallets:

- [**Auro**](https://www.aurowallet.com) - Open the wallet, tap “*Receive*”, and tap “*Copy*” to share your address or QR code representing this address.

:::note

To prevent spam, the Mina network charges a one-time account creation fee of 1 MINA. This fee is automatically deducted from the first transaction received.

:::

### Sending MINA
When sending MINA, always double check that you have the correct Mina address for the recipient.  Remember that <i>transactions on the Mina blockchain are final and irreversible</i>. 

- [**Auro**](https://www.aurowallet.com) - Open the wallet, tap “*Send*”, enter in the address, amount, and fee, and tap “*Next*” then “*Confirm*”.

:::note

When sending transactions on a blockchain, such as Mina, senders must include a transaction fee. Most wallets calculate a recommended fee. You can also view a suggested fee amount based on current network transaction volume at this community-created [Gas Station website](https://fees.mina.tools/).

:::

### Viewing your transaction on a blockchain explorer

You can view your transactions using one of the community-run blockchain explorers:

- [MinaScan](https://minascan.io/)
- [Minataur](https://minataur.net/)
- [MinaSearch](https://minasearch.com/) (in development by Granola)
