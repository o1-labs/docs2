# Mina Docs

The Mina Docs website is [docs.minaprotocol.com](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/).

## To contribute content

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the docs. To get started, see the docs [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

The docs output is generated by a CI pipeline so we can update the docs site whenever we want. The [Mina Docs](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/) website always contains the most up-to-date content available.

## How to see your doc updates on PRs

During the documentation build process, each PR goes through Vercel CI to test the doc updates and build a preview of your changes. Vercel for GitHub automatically deploys and provides preview deployment URLs. After the PR status is ready, click **Visit Preview** and navigate to the changed page to see your doc updates. If your Vercel preview fails, you might have errors. See [Debugging build errors](#debugging-build-errors).

## How to see your local doc updates during development

To test the doc build and see local updates before you push changes to GitHub, be sure to build the docs locally.

<!-- In case of version change, update .github/workflows/{test-tutorials.yml, snarkjs-api-reference.md} accordingly -->

Local builds require Node.js, version 18 or greater.
One way to install NPM is to rely on [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Use the following commands to install nvm and npm:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install v18
```

After your local build environment is set, you can run a local build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command does not run with broken link detection.

## Debugging build errors

To build the site with broken link detection and to debug Vercel CI failures, you can gather more information on your local build:

```sh
npm run build
```

## How to run in production

On the host:

- Set environment variables: `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` and `ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY` to appropriate values
- Set build command: `npm run build`
- Set output directory: `build`
- Set install command: `npm ci`
